## January 23rd - Make a thing

#### Thoughts about Twine and using Twine as my engine
- I want to take advantage of the fact that it is mostly 
imagination and written.
- trying to make the hyperlink not too clunky ? and try 
  and integrate it.
- maybe dive into a possible idea for a future project in 
  this class?


#### Ideas/concepts
1. A blind detective or someone that does not see well 
conventionally

2. A communication device with someone like lifeline 
   game 2015 type deal
   - journal of someone magical type ( feeling like a 
      conversation) (learning about that world)
   - Someone in trouble and only communication grounded in 
     real life ( basically a puzzle game but with additional steps and a proxy.)
   - log of a crew or something that is increased making you on the edge of your seat ( so just a book but instead a making it “electronic”)



#### playtest-ish feedback

reading is long lmao
someone who finished it and knew about mythology liked the idea of helping someone in communication
More hints of what the mural and story mean since it wasn’t too obvious
People used the back around immediately, maybe making a save to go back or take advantage of it. People would go back with that arrow instead of setting up something.
People doesn't stay on the death screen too long, so if there is a timed even,t don’t make it too long
