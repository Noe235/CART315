[project for class today](//Projects/Journal.md)

## January 23rd - Make a thing

#### Thoughts about Twine and using Twine as an engine
- I want to take advantage of the fact that it is mostly 
imagination and written.
- trying to make the hyperlink not too clunky ? and try 
  and integrate it.
- maybe dive into a possible idea for a future project in 
  this class?

#### Ideas/concepts
1. A blind detective or someone that does not see well 
conventionally

2. A communication device with someone like lifeline 
   game 2015 type deal
   - journal of someone magical type ( feeling like a 
      conversation) (learning about that world)
   - Someone in trouble and only communication grounded in 
     real life ( basically a puzzle game but with additional steps and a proxy.)
   - log of a crew or something that is increased making you on the edge of your seat ( so just a book but instead a making it “electronic”)

#### playtest-ish feedback

- reading is long lmao 
- someone who finished it and knew about mythology 
- liked the idea of helping someone in communication 
- More hints of what the mural and story mean since it wasn’t too obvious 
- People used the back around immediately, maybe making a save to go back or take advantage of it. People would go back with that arrow instead of setting up something. 
- People doesn't stay on the death screen too long, so if there is a timed even,t don’t make it too long


## January 30rd

Idea for a collector type of game. 
Ideas:
- A dodging type of game like subway surfers?
- A beginning of a rhythm game like prosekai
- A simple collection game nothing fancy
- A game where you grow bigger when you eat things

probably going to try and do the prosekai-ish. So restraining the player to a specific position. The position will be stored in an array probably like this:
myPos []= new position maybe vector 3?

then do the same for the dropper and change the frequency.
change the sprite for a guitar and notes
adding some sound and a little menu page just to start it.


Testing out the code tonight and if it doesn’t work going back ot the basic collecting game


_**REMINDER FOR NOE**_ <br>
if you have a number with points, and you have this error <br>
``Cannot convert expression of type 'double' to type 'float'`` <br>
you need to put “f” at the end of the number to tell it its a float still
